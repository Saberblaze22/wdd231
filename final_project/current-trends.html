            <ul>
                <li>currently the most popular genres are isekai. the isekai genre intails two types of story. the first is dieing and being reborn as either a baby or an object. they are also able to be reborn as an animal.
                    the other type is the main charecter being summoned or sent to another world for a new chance at life as either the hero or as sumeone who was summoned at the same time as the hero.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>anime previous-trend</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>the previous trend was going over the fantasy genre as people lived in a world filled with magic. the world usually followed either a charecter with no skills or a person who lost their 
                    abilities due to either a curse or illness. this is one of the most popular kinds of anime as it is very different from reality.
